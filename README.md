Homework to create simple reactive currency convertor

## Task

- Create simple page with labeled input boxes for each currency supported by given API (it can change!), start with amount 1 in first currency type.
- When user edits amount in any field, other will be recalculated.
- Every second are rates updates and boxes recalculated, it can be turned on/off by button.
- Using some CSS (framework) is optional but would be nice...

You can use any Haskell or Haskell-like technology for frontend that was introduced in the tutorial. We recommend to use Elm.
